# Real-Time Order Processing Monitor

A production-grade real-time monitoring system for e-commerce order pipelines â€” built with **Go**, **Redis**, **Gorilla WebSocket**, **Docker**, and **Prometheus + Grafana** for observability.

This service streams **live order events** to a browser dashboard with **millisecond latency**, enabling instant visibility into queue health, latency trends, and failure conditions.

## ğŸš€ Features

- **Real-time WebSocket dashboard** using Go + Gorilla WebSocket
- **Redis Pub/Sub ingestion layer** decoupling producers from WebSocket broadcast
- **Concurrency-safe fanout with goroutines** and graceful connection lifecycle
- **Live metrics tracking** â€” queue depth, p95 latency, failure rates
- **Prometheus + Grafana integration** for production-grade observability
- **Dockerized deployment** with `docker-compose up --build`
